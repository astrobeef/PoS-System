# Clean Kitchen Pos System 


## Description

PoS systems are used in kitchens to track food orders and their progress.  However, these systems could use an upgrade within their design.

Our project is a readible, user-friendly PoS System for kitchens.  Currently set up for the back of the house.

## Goal

Our goal was to create a clean, understandable PoS System by incorporating color coding, icons, and easier navigation.

## Achievements

- We were able to create a kitchen view with expo and stations, but we were unable to create a full waiter/waitress view.
- We set up color coding.
- We created an easy-to-use navigation menu.
- We created a modular station set up, allowing for an endless amount of stations.

## Future Developments

- We would develop the kitchen to incorporate more elements which would improve the readablity of our system.
- We would develop the front-of-house PoS system.
